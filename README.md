## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This is my first frontend project. I familiarized myself with the basic css display properties and learned how to center elements using display: flex; 

```css
.main {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I should make a separate file with the CSS. Also, I look forward to learning different ways to organize content on a webpage.
